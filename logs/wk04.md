# Learning Log - Week 4 (2/10/2026 - 2/12/2026)

## What I learned this week
[Key concepts — focus on understanding, not syntax]

- ul stands for unordered list, li stands for list item.
- ctrl+shift+I to open copilot agent in vscode
- I'm understanding the structure of html better, the semantic tags are a little clearer to me now.
## Code I'm proud of (optional)
[A snippet + what it does and why]

- I'm proud of the s06 demo html code I wrote on my own.


## Challenges I faced
[What was hard? How did I work through it?]

## AI usage (if any)
[What I asked, how I used/modified the output]

- Used copilot agent to generate an html guide under s07-demo.html

## Questions going forward
[What's still unclear? What do I want to explore?]

- I need to better understand the necessity of the tags that don't show any visible changes.
