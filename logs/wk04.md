# Learning Log - Week 4 (2/10/2026 - 2/12/2026)
## Quiz next Thursday, 2/19

## What I learned this week
[Key concepts — focus on understanding, not syntax]

- ul stands for unordered list, li stands for list item.
- ctrl+shift+I to open copilot agent in vscode
- I'm understanding the structure of html better, the semantic tags are a little clearer to me now.
- Future Required Projects:
    - https://oim3690.github.io/slides/s08-agenda.html#7
      - Will need to create new repositories for each project, then link to OIM3690 repo 
- Html dictionary https://curio-team.github.io/vocabs/?name=html&lang=en

- internal vs external CSS
  - internal is within the html file, external is in a separate file and linked to the html file.
  - the last link in the head is the one that is used 
## Code I'm proud of (optional)
[A snippet + what it does and why]

- I'm proud of the s06 demo html code I wrote on my own.


## Challenges I faced
[What was hard? How did I work through it?]

## AI usage (if any)
[What I asked, how I used/modified the output]

- Used copilot agent to generate an html guide under s07-demo.html

## Questions going forward
[What's still unclear? What do I want to explore?]

- I need to better understand the necessity of the tags that don't show any visible changes.
  - Div just groups things together.
